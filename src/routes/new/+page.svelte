<h1>A Modal Webpage</h1>
<p>This screen was presented as a modal based on the path configuration file. Submitting this form will redirect to a success page. The native app will receive that visit proposal and initiate a new visit.
Notice that submitting the form will also cause it to dismiss the modal. That's handled by the demo app's router.</p>
